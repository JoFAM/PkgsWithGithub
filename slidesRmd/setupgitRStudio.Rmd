## Make RStudio find git

If everything is installed, RStudio should be able to find git. It might be though that RStudio isn't set up to work with git yet. In order to do so:

 1. Go to Tools > Global Options in RStudio.
 2. Click on Git/VSN
 3. If necessary, select "Enable version control interface for RStudio projects".
 4. If necessary, add the location of the Git executable.

If you can't find the executable, you can open a terminal and use one of following commands:

```
where git  # on Windows
which git  # on Linux/Mac
```

This will give you the location of the git executable.

## Create a token (PAT) for login 

Recently, GitHub changed its policy. You won't be able to connect to your repositories if you don't create a PAT. You can work through SSH, but a PAT is easier to set up.

You can see a PAT as a unique password that can only be used for connecting. 

To set create a PAT, follow the steps 1 to 9 on the following link:

https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

In step 7, select "repo" and "delete repo".

**WARNING: WHEN YOU CREATE A PAT, YOU CAN ONLY SEE IT ONCE. COPY IT TO EG NOTEPAD SO YOU DON'T LOSE IT!**

You'll need this the first time you connect RStudio to GitHub. After that, everything is stored in the credential manager of your operating system and you don't need to bother about it any more.
