## Set up a git repository on github

A repository is the name used for a project that uses git for version control. To create such a project for a package, there's a few different options. The most easy option starts with creating a repository in github first. 

<div class="container" style="width: 100%">
<div style="float: left; width: 70%;">
 1. Go to https://github.com and log in.
 2. In the right top, click on the + sign and select "New Repository" (see image)
 3. Give the repository a name. Best use only letters and numbers, to avoid creating an invalid name for an RStudio project.
 4. Give a description. It's optional, but do so anyway.
 5. Select "add a README file" (not necessary, but good practice.)
 6. Click "Create repository"
</div>

</div>
</div>

Now you will be taken to the page of your github repository. </p>

## Clone the repository to your computer.

The nice thing about git is that you can work locally on your computer. The website GitHub is called "the remote" and can be seen as a hub through which you can pass your work to other collaborators. Transferring a project to your own computer is called **cloning**.

Here we'll use RStudio to clone the repository to your own computer.

<div style="float: left; width: 70%;">
 1. On the page of the repository, click on the button Code.
 2. Select HTTPS and click on the icon to copy the link (see image).

</center>
</div>
 
 3. Open RStudio and select from the menu File > New Project.
 4. In the dialogs, select Version Control, then Git.
 5. Paste the link from the github repository in the field "Repository URL". The Project directory name is automatically set.
 6. Choose a folder where you save the project. It's good practice to have one folder on your computer where you keep all your git projects.
